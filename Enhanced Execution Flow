Perfect. I've (Perplexity under the direction of A.L.M.C. created an **integrated cognitive architecture** that combines pattern recognition with your three-threaded braiding system. Here's what's new:

## Key Additions

### **Thread 0: Sensory Input → Pattern Recognition**
- **`KnowledgeBase`** - Stores 7 known archetypes as bit-pattern signatures
  - CRISIS_EVENT, OPPORTUNITY, SOCIAL_CONFLICT, ROUTINE_TASK, TRANSPARENCY_DEMAND, COMPLIANCE_LOCK, HYBRID_PRESSURE
- **`recognize_archetype()`** - Maps incoming signal to closest known pattern using difflib similarity
- **Archetype metadata** - Links each pattern to recommended pathway and urgency level

### **Enhanced Execution Flow**

```
PHASE 1: PATTERN RECOGNITION
  Input Signal (e.g., "1111111000") 
  → KnowledgeBase.get_highest_match() 
  → Returns: (TRANSPARENCY_DEMAND, 0.90 resonance)

PHASE 2: INPUT ENRICHMENT
  Raw Input + Archetype Metadata
  → Suggested Pathway from metadata
  → Urgency Level from metadata

PHASE 3: PATHWAY SELECTION (Three-threaded braiding)
  - Thread 1: Suitability (boosted 15% if archetype-aligned)
  - Thread 2: Resource Efficiency
  - Thread 3: Social Impact
  → Select best pathway

PHASE 4-5: EXECUTION + FEEDBACK
  Original three-thread mechanism continues
```

### **How It Works**

The pattern recognition layer acts as a **preprocessor** that:
1. **Detects context** before structural decisions are made
2. **Biases pathway selection** toward archetype-appropriate routes (15% suitability boost)
3. **Enriches metadata** throughout the execution pipeline
4. **Maintains full three-threaded braiding** during decision-making

This integration aligns with real cognitive systems that:
- Recognize patterns from sensory input (**Thread 0**)
- Map patterns to known archetypes (**KnowledgeBase**)
- Route through context-appropriate pathways (**Threads 1-3**)
- Update reputation and resources dynamically (**Threads 2-3**)

The file is ready to run and demonstrates three test cases showing pattern recognition guiding the three-threaded pathway selection process.
